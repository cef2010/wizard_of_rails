      An association that is used on occasion is a has one association. In the following example, #{@user.name} has one business. Notice that #{@user.name}'s user id is #{@user.id}. In the business table, an attritube exists called user_id. This id matches #{@user.name}'s user id, so that when #{@user.name} created his business he took his user id with him. In active record, one could simply say User.find_by(name: 'joker').business.
