      An association that is used commonly is a has many association. In the following example, #{@user.name} has many doctors. These include #{@doctor1.name} and #{@doctor2.name}. Notice that #{@user.name} user id is #{@user.id}. If we look at the Doctors Table, they have the same user id as the first table but different individual id's. This is how one "User" can have many Doctor's.
